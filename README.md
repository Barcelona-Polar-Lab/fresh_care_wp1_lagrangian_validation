## 📝 Description

This directory contains high-performance tools to evaluate the accuracy of satellite-derived and fused surface current datasets (such as `ADT-SST`, `ADT-SSS`, etc.) by advecting virtual particles and comparing predicted trajectories against true observed drifter pathways using the LUQ metric.

## ✨ Features
* **Configurable Evaluation Parameters:** Flexible temporal filtering and dataset bounding.
* **Multi-Dataset Support:** Handles diverse current product formats simultaneously.
* **Performance-Optimized Execution:** Leverages `Numba` JIT compilation to handle heavy spatial array manipulations and Lagrangian integrations efficiently.
* **Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Easy-to-use terminal parameters with structured CSV/dataframe outputs.

## 🚀 Usage

### Basic Evaluation
Run the standard pipeline with default settings:

```bash
python run_evaluation.py
```

### Custom evaluation
Specify target datasets, advection time horizons (tau days), and custom temporal windows:

```bash
python run_evaluation.py --datasets ADT-SST --tau_days 5 10 --eval_start 2021-10-01 --eval_end 2021-12-31 
```

### Available options 
To view all available configuration flags:
```bash
python run_evaluation.py --help
```

## ⚙️ Configuration & Installation

### Configuration
Edit `config.py` directly to modify:
* Local dataset root paths and NetCDF internal variable names.
* Default evaluation parameters, advection tolerances, and output directories.

### Requirements
* Python 3.8+
* NumPy, Pandas, Xarray, Numba

### Installation
Ensure you are inside the repository environment and run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
